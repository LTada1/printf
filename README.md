This directory contains files on C printf. This is our forst team projectdone during sofware
engineering course at ALX.

The project was structured as follows:

Task 0: A function that produces output according to a format. It is set to emulate the
standard library printf function.

Task 1: Handles some conversion specifiers (i and d) passed to it.

Task 2: Handles custom conversion specifiers. Converts unsigned int to Binary.

Task 3: Hanldes conversion specifiers such as hexadecimal and others.

Task 4: A function that uses a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call wite as little
as possible, this writes all character from buffer.

Task 5: A function that handles some custom specifiers, prints string and non printable
charaters.

Task 6: A function that handles the conversion specifier.

Task 7: A function that handles flag characters for non custom specifiers. This include
space, hash tag and the positive sign.

Task 8: A function that handle length modifiers for non custom specifiers which include
integer, hexadecimal and others.

Task 9: A function that handles fieldd width for non custom specifiers.

Task 10: A function that handles precision for non custom specifiers.

Task 11: A function that handles the 0 flag character for non custom specifiers.

Task 12: A function that handles negative (-) flag for non custom specifiers.

Task 13: A function that handles a custom conversion specifier which is, r that prints the reversed string.

Task 14: A function that handles a custom converion specifier which is R that prints the rot13'ed string.

Task 15: Make sure that all the above options work well together.
